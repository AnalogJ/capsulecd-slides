**Title:** Continuous Delivery for Versioned Libraries using CapsuleCD

**Abstract:** Continuous Integration (and Continuous Deployment) is one of the foundations of the DevOps movement. However, while its common to see automation pipelines for testing and deploying applications all the way to production, there’s very little discussion about how to reliably release versioned libraries which our applications depend on. CapsuleCD is a generic Continuous Delivery pipeline for versioned artifacts and libraries written in any language. It automates away all the common steps required when creating a new version of your library, while still being flexible enough to support your deployment logic. In this lightning talk I’ll go over those common steps, describe some of the many features of CapsuleCD, and do a demo of how CapsuleCD could integrate with your existing CI workflow.
